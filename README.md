# Motorchik
Motorchik, discord bot written in python.

## Longer about
Motorchik is a discord bot, written in python using ![discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py).
At current state Motorchik provides simple tools for discord servers, such as delete a number of messages, ban or kick someone, give default roles to new members, etc.
Per-server configuration system is still en development, but working (not working: command black-/whitelisting). Also pr-user configuration system is in development and kind of working (`user-config` branch).

## Features
* Misc
  - Greeting message on member join.
  - Message when member leaves
* Factorio stuff
  - Get a mod's statistics and disaply as embed.
  - Send a list of mod statistics info (the list can't be changed for `$new_mods_statistics`, which is a Motorchik's realisation. `$mods_statistics` require ![ÂµBot](https://github.com/arielbeje/uBot) at the server)
* Configuration
  - Motorchik is highly configurable for users and servers (guilds).

  `~/.config/systemd/user/Motorchik.service`
  ```ini

  [Install]
  WantedBy=default.target
  ```
  And then
  ```
  $ systemctl --user enable Motorchik.service
  $ systemctl --user start Motorchik.service
  ```
  Everything will be logged to STDIN, so you can view entire bot's log with:
  ```
  $ journalctl --user -u Motorchik.service
  ```
